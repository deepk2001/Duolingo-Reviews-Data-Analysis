        "To analyze user reviews, the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis model was selected due to its suitability for short, informal text data such as mobile application reviews.\n",

        "VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media and user-generated content. Unlike traditional machine learning models, it does not require labeled training data, making it computationally efficient and easy to implement for large-scale review datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the primary reasons for choosing VADER is its ability to handle linguistic nuances commonly found in app reviews, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Emphasis through capitalization (e.g., \"THIS UPDATE IS TERRIBLE\")\n",
        "- Repeated punctuation (e.g., \"awful!!!\")\n",
        "- Degree modifiers (e.g., \"very bad\", \"extremely slow\")\n",
        "- Negations (e.g., \"not good\")\n",
        "- Informal language and short expressions\n",
        "\n",
        "VADER produces four sentiment metrics: positive, negative, neutral, and a compound score. The compound score ranges from -1 to +1 and represents the normalized overall sentiment of a review.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this study, the compound score was used for classification as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compound ≥ 0.05 → Positive  \n",
        "- Compound ≤ -0.05 → Negative  \n",
